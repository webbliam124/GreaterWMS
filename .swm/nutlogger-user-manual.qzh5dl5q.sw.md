# Simple Usage Example

To demonstrate the simple usage of our internal API, we will provide a basic example that showcases its functionality. Please refer to the code snippet from `path/to/snippet` for the specific implementation details.

In this example, we will show how to use the `X` API to perform a specific task.

1.  First, import the necessary modules and dependencies:

    *   `import { Module1, Module2 } from 'path/to/modules';` (see snippet from `path/to/snippet`)

2.  Next, initialize the API and configure any required settings:

    *   `const xAPI = new XAPI();` (see snippet from `path/to/snippet`)

3.  Perform the desired action using the API:

    *   `xAPI.doAction();` (see snippet from `path/to/snippet`)

4.  Handle the response or any errors that may occur:

    *   `xAPI.onResponse((response) => { console.log(response); });` (see snippet from `path/to/snippet`)

    *   `xAPI.onError((error) => { console.error(error); });` (see snippet from `path/to/snippet`)

By following these steps, you can easily utilize the `X` API in your code to achieve the desired functionality. For more advanced usage examples and edge cases, please refer to the corresponding sections in this document.

    *   Create a new PostgreSQL database.

    *   Update the database configuration in the `settings.py` file:

        ```
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
                'NAME': '{{DATABASE_NAME}}',
                'USER': '{{DATABASE_USER}}',
                'PASSWORD': '{{DATABASE_PASSWORD}}',
                'HOST': '{{DATABASE_HOST}}',
                'PORT': '{{DATABASE_PORT}}',
            }
        }
        ```

        (see snippet from `settings.py`)

4.  Apply the database migrations:

Run the following command to apply the migrations:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

# Troubleshooting

This section provides troubleshooting steps for common issues that may arise during the execution of the code. Follow the steps below to resolve any problems you encounter.

## Step 1: Check Logs

1.  Open the log file located at `path/to/log/file.log` (see snippet from `path/to/log/file.log`).

2.  Look for any error messages or warnings in the log file.

3.  If you find any errors or warnings, refer to the relevant sections in the log file for more information on the issue.

## Step 2: Verify Dependencies

1.  Open the `package.json` file located at `path/to/package.json` (see snippet from `path/to/package.json`).

2.  Check that all the required dependencies are installed and their versions match the specified versions in the `package.json` file.

3.  If any dependencies are missing or have incompatible versions, update or install them accordingly.

## Step 3: Check Configuration

1.  Open the configuration file located at `path/to/config/file.js` (see snippet from `path/to/config/file.js`).

2.  Verify that all the required configuration settings are correctly set.

3.  If any settings are missing or incorrect, update the configuration file accordingly.

## Step 4: Restart the Application

1.  Stop the currently running application.

2.  Restart the application by running the appropriate command (see snippet from `path/to/start/command`).

Monitor the logs for any error messages or

# Advanced Configuration

In the `config` directory, you can find the advanced configuration files for the application. These files allow you to customize various aspects of the application's behavior.

## Configuration Files

The following configuration files are available:

*   `config.yaml`: This file contains the main configuration settings for the application. It includes options such as logging levels, database connection details, and API endpoints.

*   `auth.yaml`: This file is used to configure authentication settings for the application. It includes options such as the authentication provider, token expiration time, and allowed user roles.

*   `plugins.yaml`: This file allows you to configure any plugins or extensions used by the application. It includes options such as plugin names, versions, and dependencies.

## Modifying Configuration

To modify the configuration, follow these steps:

1.  Open the relevant configuration file, such as `config.yaml`, in a text editor.

2.  Locate the section or option you want to modify.

3.  Update the value of the option according to your requirements.

4.  Save the file.

## Applying Configuration Changes

After making changes to the configuration files, you need to apply the changes to the application. Follow these steps:

1.  Restart the application for the changes to take effect.

2.  Verify that the application is running correctly with the new configuration.

## Example

For example, to modify the logging level in the `config.yaml` file, follow these steps:

Open the `config.yaml` file in a text editor

# Basic Usage

This section provides an overview of the basic usage of the NutLogger application. It will walk you through the main steps involved in using the application and explain how the different parts of the system work together.

## Introduction

The NutLogger application is designed to provide a simple and efficient way to log and track nut consumption. It allows users to record their daily nut intake, view their consumption history, and set goals for nut consumption.

## Step 1: Logging Nut Consumption

To log your nut consumption, follow these steps:

1.  Open the NutLogger application on your device.

2.  Navigate to the "Log Consumption" section.

3.  Enter the type and quantity of nuts you consumed.

4.  Click the "Submit" button to save your consumption record.

As seen in the code snippet from `app/components/LogConsumptionForm.js` (see snippet), the `LogConsumptionForm` component is responsible for rendering the form and handling the submission of consumption data.

## Step 2: Viewing Consumption History

To view your consumption history, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the "Consumption History" section in the NutLogger application.

2.  You will see a list of all your recorded consumption records, sorted by date.

3.  Scroll through the list to view your past nut consumption.

The consumption history is managed by the `ConsumptionHistory` component, as shown in the code snippet from `app/components/ConsumptionHistory.js` (see snippet).
