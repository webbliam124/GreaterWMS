# Step 1: Fetching Data

In this section, we will walk through the process of fetching data in the codebase.

To fetch data, we follow the following steps:

1.  The entry point for fetching data is located in the `path/to/entrypoint.ts` file (see snippet from `path/to/entrypoint.ts`). This file contains the main function that initiates the data fetching process.

2.  Inside the entry point function, we make use of the `fetchData` function from the `path/to/fetchData.ts` module (see snippet from `path/to/fetchData.ts`). This function is responsible for making the actual API request to retrieve the data.

3.  The `fetchData` function uses the `axios` library to send an HTTP request to the specified API endpoint. The endpoint URL is defined in the `path/to/config.ts` file (see snippet from `path/to/config.ts`).

4.  Once the data is successfully fetched, it is returned as a response from the API. The response is then processed and transformed as needed in the `path/to/processData.ts` module (see snippet from `path/to/processData.ts`).

5.  Finally, the processed data is passed to the appropriate components or stored in the application state for further usage.

By following these steps, we ensure that data is fetched and processed correctly in the codebase.
